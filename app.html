        How the Web Works
      </div>
      <div class="concept-description">
        <p>
         The web consits out of computers that communicate with each other. When a person goes to a web page, the computer sends a HTTP Request to a server. The server finds the appropriate HTML document and sends it back to the user's computer where a web browser interprets the page and displays it on the user's screen. Generally, the main type of document on the web is HTML.

        HTML
      </div>
      <div class="concept-description">
        <p>
          HTML stands for <em>Hypertext Markup Language</em> which contains <em>text content</em> which describes "what you see" and <em>markup</em> which describes "how it looks". <br><br>
  The HTML markup consist of an opening tag and a closing tag while the whole thing is called an <b>element</b>, e.g.: <br><br>
                <b>Inline</b>
                       
                           <br>&#60;b&#62;= Bold
                           <br>&#60;em&#62;= Italics
                           <br>&#60;a&#62;= Anchor (add hyperlinks, needs attribute like href)
                           <br>&#60;img&#62;= Image (no closing tag, needs source and alt text)
                           <br>&#60;br&#62;= Line Break (no closing tag)
                           <br>&#60;q&#62;= Short Quotation
                           <br>&#60;strong&#62;= Defines Important Text
                        
                     <br><br>
                     <b>Block</b>
                        
                           <br>&#60;p&#62;= Paragraph (can give heigth and width)
                            <br>&#60;body&#62;= Body
                            <br>&#60;form&#62;= User Input Field
                        
                  
  <br><br>
Generally an HTML tag is always contained within angled brackets. Most tags have an opening tag and a closing tag. Some tags (called "void" tags) do not require a closing tag.<br>

        Tags and Elements

      <div class="concept-description">
        <p>
          HTML is written in sentences or elements composed of tags and text. Tags are the markers that tell the text or source how to act or look. In general tags can have multipe attributes, e.g. anchors tags can include links (the tags use the href attribute which includes the actual link). <br><br>The image tag for instance uses the "src" attribute. Important here is that the image tag is a so called "void tag". It doesn't have any content and therefore doesn't have a closing tag. An image is included by: "img src="url" alt="text". The text gets discplyed when the images is not there.

        Inline vs Block Elements
      </div>
      <div class="concept-description">
        <p>
          HTML elements are either <b>inline</b> or <b>block</b>. Block
  elements form an "invisible box" around the content inside of
  them.

  Text is displayed on multiple lines. <br><br>In order to break text one need to use the "br" tag which is an inline-element. Alternatively one can use the "p" tag which stands for paragraph and which is a block-element.

          Everything on a webpage is a box while the style can be applied through CSS.<br><br>

HTML and CSS are two programming "languages". While HTML controls the "structure" of a web page, CSS controls the "style" of a page, i.e. how it looks. When programmers talk about the "DOM" (Document Object Model) they are talking about the <strong>"tree-like structure"</strong> of a page. The "tree-like structure" comes from the fact that HTML elements can have other elements inside of them. You can draw this relationship like a family tree. My mother had multiple children. So did her mother, and so on...<br><br>

        What is CSS?

      <div class="concept-description">
        <p>
          CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets and they give programmers a way to control the style of related HTML elements. This is done by giving similar HTML elements the same class-name and then specifying the style that should apply to that class.

	Avoiding Errors
	</div>
	<div class="concept-description">
        <p>
          When programmers <em>don't</em> avoid repetition, they will often have to do the same thing over and over. This may mean copy and pasting certain style attributes into many HTML elements or rewriting the same code (sometimes with minor differences) many times. This can lead to errors when the programmer decides to make a change to something. If they don't dilligently make that same change everywhere the repeated code appears, problems will arise.

	The Box Model
	</div>
	<div class="concept-description">
	<p>

 There are four main points to note about box sizing: <br><br>
1. HTML elements are boxes and each box has 4 components: Margin, border, padding and the content. Please note that the margin is not including in the size of the actual box. <br>
2. Because there are so many components to each box, it can often be hard to get the size of a box just right.<br>
3. There are two techniques one can use to help deal with sizing issues.
	Set sizes in terms of percents rather than pixels.
	Set the box-sizing attribute to border-box for every element.  <br>
4. Different browsers work slightly differently. Sometimes this causes different browsers to display the same code differently.<br>

<br>
Box Positioning<br>
Divs are block elements (as opposed to inline), so by default they take up the entire width of a page.
Adding the rule display: flex; to the appropriate CSS will override this behavior and let divs appear next to each other.
